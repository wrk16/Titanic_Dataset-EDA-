# EDA using Titanic dataset

This repository implements a machine learning approach to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster. It leverages the well-known Titanic dataset to explore passenger characteristics and build a Logistic Regression model for survival prediction. Here we have used a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning.

## Key Functionalities

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Loads and cleans the Titanic dataset.
- Analyzes passenger features (age, class, sex, etc.) using visualizations and statistical methods.
- Identifies relationships between features and survival outcomes.
2. Data Preprocessing
- Handles missing values using imputation techniques.
- Encodes categorical variables for Logistic Regression compatibility.
3. Logistic Regression Model
- Trains a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival.
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Analyzes model coefficients to understand feature impact on survival probability.


This repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in data analysis, machine learning, and the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
